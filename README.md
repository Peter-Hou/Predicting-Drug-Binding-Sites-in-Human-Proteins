# Predicting-Drug-Binding-Sites-in-Human-Proteins
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict probable drug-binding sites in human proteins. The model will be trained on a dataset provided by CYCLICA, which includes features derived exclusively from AlphaFold2 protein structures and labels indicating whether each residue is a 'drug binding' or 'non-drug binding' site. The final model will be evaluated on its ability to reliably predict drug-binding sites and the features most important for drug binding will be demonstrated. This project will contribute to the advancement of drug discovery and the development of new medicines.
